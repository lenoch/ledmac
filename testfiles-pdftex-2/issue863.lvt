\stanza Pray give me favour, sir. This cunning Cardinal&
The articles o' th' combination drew&
As himself pleased; and they were ratified&
As he cried, `Thus let be,' to as much end&
As give a crutch to th' dead. But our Count-Cardinal&
Has done this, and 'tis well, for worthy Wolsey,&
Who cannot err, he did it. Now this follows,&
Which, as I take it, is a kind of puppy&
To th' old dam treason, Charles the Emperor,&
Under pretence to see the Queen his aunt,&
For 'twas indeed his colour, but he came&
To whisper Wolsey, here makes visitation.&
His fears were that the interview betwixt&
England and France might through their amity&
Breed him some prejudice, for from this league&
Peeped harms that menaced him. He privily&
Deals with our cardinal, and, as I trow,&
Which I do well, for I am sure the Emperor&
Paid ere he promised, whereby his suit was granted&
Ere it was asked, but when the way was made&
And paved with gold, the Emperor thus desired&
That he would please to alter the King's course&
And break the foresaid peace. Let the King know,&
As soon he shall by me, that thus the Cardinal&
Does buy and sell his honour as he pleases,&
And for his own advantage.\&
